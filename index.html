        <dt><b>There are 4 main positions that you'll need to know:</b></dt>
        <dd>Dealer Button (or BTN)</dd>
        <dd>Small Blind (SB)</dd>
        <dd>Big Blind (BB)</dd>
        <dd>Under-The-Gun (UTG)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p> Each position can play a different role in the game. Starting with the
      dealer and moving clockwise, each position is as follows, small blind, big
      blind, under the gun, highjack, and cutoff. There can be as many under the
      gun players as you want, as long as the rest of the positions are filled.
      The dealer then passes each player, starting with the small blind, 1 card
      at a time until each player has 2 cards. The small blind and big blinds,
      before even getting their cards, contribute a predetermined amount to the
      pot. After every has gotten their cards, the first UTG begins the first
      round of betting. After the first round of betting completes, the dealer
      then "burns", or puts one card face down, and then reveals the next 3
      cards, also called the <b>flop.</b> After the flop another round of betting
      ensues, starting with the small blind (or the leftmost, still active,
      player in the game). Then the dealer must burn another card, and reveal
      the next card, also called the <b>turn.</b> After another round of betting
      the dealer burns one more card revealing the last and final card the
      <b>river.</b> After the river card one final round of betting happens, and
      each player reveals his hand, with the winner taking the pot.</p>

        <dl class="center">
          <dt class="left"><b>Each player may perform one of 4 actions:</b></dt>
          <dd class="left">Check</dd>
          <dd class="left">Call</dd>
          <dd class="left">Raise</dd>
          <dd class="left">Fold</dd>
        </dl>
        <p> Beginning with the person UTG, they may check, which means to not
        bet anything, raise, which means to bet some amount of money (normally
        in multiples of the big blind, or the previous bet), or fold, which means to burn your cards,
        and leave this round of poker. After a bet has been made, the next
        person to bet cannot check, and must either, call, which means to match
        the amount of money the person who bet put in the pot, raise, or fold.
        After the last round of betting, all players who are still in the round,
        must reveal their cards. The person with the best hand, wins. If a
        player does not have enough money to call, but still wants to play their
        hand, they may all-in, which means to push all their money into the pot.
        However, if they win, they can only win the amount of money that was
        thrown into the pot up to that round of betting. All bets after an all
        in, are put in a side pot to be split by the people who still have
        enough money at the end of the round of poker.</p>
